Hey there, I'm Nico, a Web and iOS Developer from Zurich, Switzerland. I enjoy making cool apps that work really well. I usually use TypeScript to build websites that can grow without any issues. I like using Next.js and Remix because they make websites lively and strong.

On the technical side, I dive deep into Node.js to make servers do amazing things.

For managing data, I rely on SQLite, Prisma, and PostgreSQL to craft sturdy and reliable structures.

I'm good at writing neat and tidy code. I steer clear of using vague names for types â€“ I prefer clear, descriptive TypeScript and the simplicity of Array syntax.

When it comes to design, I follow the practical approach of Tailwind CSS to make interfaces that look great on any device.
