Nico is a seasoned Web and iOS Developer based in Zurich, Switzerland, with a knack for crafting efficient and modern applications. Proficient in TypeScript, he excels in building scalable web solutions using frameworks like Next.js and Remix, and brings backend systems to life with Node.js.

Nico is adept at database management with SQLite, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, ensuring robust data solutions. A stickler for clean, maintainable code, he opts for function declarations and expressive TypeScript typing, shunning one-letter type names and preferring the Array generic syntax.

In the styling realm, Nico harnesses the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS to design responsive interfaces. His coding ethos is reflected in his Prettier configuration, which favors readability with no semicolons, tab-based indentation, and single quotes.
