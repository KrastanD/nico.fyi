Notice that when you click "Next admin page", the client time in template above **will not change**. This is because while the URL changes, the component that renders the page of that link is the same is the component that renders this page, [app/(experiments)/experiments/suspense-demo/with-template/admin/[id]/page.tsx](<https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/app/(experiments)/experiments/suspense-demo/with-template/admin/[id]/page.tsx>). I don't know if this is a bug or by design.

Meanwhile, if you click on the "Next guest page", the client time in template above **will change**. This is because the component that renders the page of that link, [app/(experiments)/experiments/suspense-demo/with-template/guest/[id]/page.tsx](<https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/app/(experiments)/experiments/suspense-demo/with-template/guest/[id]/page.tsx>), is not the same as the component that renders this page.

In other words, if the component of the children in the template.tsx doesn't change, Template behaves exactly like Layout.

In addition, if you type something in the search field, then navigate to another **guest page**, the text that you typed will be lost because the search field component is re-rendered when the page component changes.
