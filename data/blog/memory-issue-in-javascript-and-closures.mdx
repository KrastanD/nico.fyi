Recently, I came across an interesting blog post by Jake Archibald titled [Garbage collection and closures](https://jakearchibald.com/2024/garbage-collection-and-closures) where he shows how mishandling closures can lead to memory leaks. The `demo` function in the following snippet is the problematic code:

```html:memory-leak.html {12-19, 30} showLineNumbers
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Memory Leak Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id="runDemo">Run Demo</button>
    <button id="cancelDemo">Cancel Demo</button>
    <button id="forceGC">Force Garbage Collection</button>

    <script>
      function demo() {
        const bigArrayBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(100_000_000)
        const id = setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(bigArrayBuffer.byteLength)
        }, 1000)

        return () => clearTimeout(id)
      }

      let cancelDemo

      document.getElementById('runDemo').addEventListener('click', () => {
        cancelDemo = demo()
      })

      document.getElementById('cancelDemo').addEventListener('click', () => {
        if (cancelDemo) {
          cancelDemo()
          cancelDemo = null
        }
      })

      document.getElementById('forceGC').addEventListener('click', () => {
        if (window.gc) {
          window.gc()
        }
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

At first glance, this code seems straightforward:

1. It creates a large `ArrayBuffer` of 100 million bytes (about 100 MB).
2. It sets a timeout to log the size of this buffer after 1 second.
3. The cancellation function is persisted and assigned to `cancelDemo`.

## The Subtle Issue

While this code doesn't have a traditional memory leak, it does have a subtle memory retention issue. The large `ArrayBuffer` is kept in memory by the closure created in the `setTimeout` callback. This happens because the returned function of `demo` is still around after the `demo()` function has finished executing.

The `ArrayBuffer` cannot be garbage collected until the `cancelDemo` function is set to `null` (line 30). Forcing the garbage collection by clicking the "Force Garbage Collection" button also will not help in this case because the memory is still retained by the closure.

## Analyzing with Chrome DevTools

To visualize this issue, I used Chrome DevTools' Memory tab to take heap snapshots. Here's what I observed:

1. Before running the `demo()` function, the baseline memory usage was relatively low.
2. After running `demo()`, there was a significant increase in memory usage, with a large `ArrayBuffer` object present in the heap.
3. This increased memory usage persisted, even though the `demo()` function had already returned.

## The Fix

One of the ways to fix this led me to find out that `setTimeout` can accept more than two arguments. We can modify the code to pass the `ArrayBuffer` as the third argument to `setTimeout`. **This prevents the creation of a closure that captures the entire `ArrayBuffer`**. Here's the improved version:

```javascript:memory-leak-fix.html {4-6, 8} showLineNumbers
function demo() {
  const bigArrayBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(100_000_000)
  const id = setTimeout(
    (buffer) => {
      console.log(buffer.byteLength)
    },
    1000,
    bigArrayBuffer
  )

  return () => clearTimeout(id)
}

let cancelDemo = demo()
```

## Analyzing the Fix

After implementing this fix, I took new heap snapshots. As shown in the following image, the memory usage never stayed high after the `demo()` function had finished executing. Instead, it decreased to a more manageable level.
