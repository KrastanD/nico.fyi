The `satisfies` operator in TypeScript [has been available since TypeScript 4.9](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html#the-satisfies-operator), but I hadn't had the chance to use it in my production websites until a few days ago, when I finally did.

I have the following [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/?via=nicofyi) models:

```
model Participant {
  id                                       String            @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt                                DateTime          @default(now())
  participantGroup                         ParticipantGroup  @relation(fields: [participantGroupId], references: [id])
  participantGroupId                       String
}

model ParticipantGroup {
  id           String        @id @default(uuid())
  participants Participant[]
  course       Course[]

  @@map("participant_groups")
}
```

In one of my functions, I needed to:

1. Fetch a participant, including the `participantGroup`.
2. Perform some operations and then update the participant.
3. Pass the updated participant to a function, namely, the `doSomethingWithParticipant` function.

The `doSomethingWithParticipant` function requires the passed participant object to include the `participantGroup`, as follows:

```typescript
// some-file.ts
const doSomethingFirst = async () => {
  let participant = await prismaClient.participant.findFirst({
    where: {
      id: 'some-uuid',
    },
    include: {
      participantGroup: {
        include: {
          course: true,
        },
      },
    },
  })

  // do some other operations
  participant = await prismaClient.participant.update({
    where: {
      id: 'some-uuid',
    },
    data: {
      // update participant's data
    },
    include: {
      participantGroup: {
        include: {
          course: true,
        },
      },
    },
  })

  await doSomethingWithParticipant(participant)
}

// some-file2.ts
type ParticipantWithGroup = Prisma.ParticipantGetPayload<{
  include: {
    participantGroup: true
  }
}>

const doSomethingWithParticipant = async (participant: ParticipantWithGroup) => {
  // access participant.participantGroup here
}
```

As you can see, I had to repeat the `include` property in both the `findFirst` and `update` methods. If I didn't, TypeScript would raise an issue near the `doSomethingWithParticipant` function. Let's try to refactor the code by assigning the `include` property to a variable.

```typescript
const relationToInclude = {
  participantGroup: {
    include: {
      course: true,
    },
  },
}
const doSomethingFirst = async () => {
  let participant = await prismaClient.participant.findFirst({
    where: {
      id: 'some-uuid',
    },
    include: relationToInclude,
  })

  // do some other operations
  participant = await prismaClient.participant.update({
    where: {
      id: 'some-uuid',
    },
    data: {
      // update participant's data
    },
    include: relationToInclude,
  })

  await doSomethingWithParticipant(participant)
}
```

Great, now I no longer have repeating code. Additionally, TypeScript reminds me if I make a typo:

However, I've lost the autocomplete feature, and I can assign unknown properties to the `relationToInclude` object:

```typescript
const relationToInclude = {
  participantGroup: {
    include: {
      course: true,
    },
  },
  randomStuff: 'true', // this is not correct
}
```

So, my first thought was to type the `relationToInclude` variable directly as `Prisma.ParticipantInclude`:

```typescript
const relationToInclude: Prisma.ParticipantInclude = {
  participantGroup: {
    include: {
      course: true,
    },
  },
  randomStuff: 'what', // great, TypeScript showed error here!
}
```

It worked, and TypeScript threw an error for `randomStuff` because of `randomStuff`. However, TypeScript also generated another error at the line where the `doSomethingWithParticipant` function is called:

![](/static/images/articles/participant-group-error.png.webp)

This issue arose because the exact type of `Prisma.ParticipantInclude` makes `participantGroup` optional, which means it can be undefined, even though the object has `participantGroup` at runtime. Since TypeScript perceives `participantGroup` in `relationToInclude` as potentially undefined, the `findFirst` and `update` queries infer that the returned participant might not include `participantGroup`. Meanwhile, the `doSomethingWithParticipant` function expects `participantGroup` to be defined.

This is where the `satisfies` operator becomes useful. Instead of directly typing `relationToInclude` as `Prisma.ParticipantInclude`, we can use the `satisfies` operator to assert that this object meets the `Prisma.ParticipantInclude` structure.

```typescript
const relationToInclude = {
  participantGroup: {
    include: {
      course: true,
    },
  },
} satisfies Prisma.ParticipantInclude
```

This approach allows TypeScript to perform type checking on `relationToInclude`, while also enabling it to infer the exact type of `relationToInclude` in the `findFirst` and `update` queries. Consequently, TypeScript will recognize that the updated participant includes `participantGroup`.
