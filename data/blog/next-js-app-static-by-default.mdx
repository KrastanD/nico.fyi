Here's one thing you must always remember when making website with Next.js with [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). By default, every page component undergoes **static rendering**, which means HTML files are generated at build time. Take a look at this example to grasp the importance of this detail.

```typescript
// app/support/page.tsx
export default async function SupportPage() {
    const now = new Date()
    return (
        <div>
            <form action="/api/support" method="POST">
                <input type="text" name="comment" >
                <input type="hidden" name="date" value={now} />
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This code might seem fine, but there's a hidden issue. Did you spot it? The `SupportPage` component, lacking any [dynamic functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions) or a [`dynamic` constant set to `force-dynamic`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) as per Next.js documentation, _gets rendered at build time_. As a result, the `now` variable remains static, leading to outdated date values on the `/support` page, potentially causing data inconsistency in your database.

To address this, you should enable dynamic rendering. This can be achieved by exporting a `dynamic` constant set to `force-dynamic`:

```typescript
// app/support/page.tsx

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export default async function SupportPage() {
    const now = new Date()
    return (
        <div>
            <form action="/api/support" method="POST">
                <input type="text" name="comment" >
                <input type="hidden" name="date" value={now} />
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    )
}
```
