I've been thinking of buying a Mac mini to replace my Macbook Pro as my main computer at home. But it turned out I didn't need to buy since my company loaned me a Mac mini to use at home! So it's time to set up this thing. Setting up a new computer is both fun and annoying. There are some features that I wish were a default.

# Desktop

1. Enable dock magnification. (System Preferences ➡️ Dock)
2. Show the day of the week and the date in menu bar. (System Preferences ➡️ Date and Time ➡️ Clock)

# Keyboard

1. Add custom keyboard shortcut for switching to the other windows of the same app. I always use Option+Tab for this. (System Preferences ➡️ Keyboard ➡️ Shortcuts ➡️ Keyboard ➡️ Move Focus to The Next Window)
2. Change Full Keyboard Access to All Controls. (System Preferences ➡️ Keyboard ➡️ Shortcuts ➡️ All Controls)
3. Disable automatic spell correction. I usually type in three languages: English, Indonesian, and Japanese. The automatic spelling correction annoys me so much when I type in Indonesian. (System Preferences ➡️ Keyboard ➡️ Text)

# Trackpad

1. Enable Tap to Click. (System Preferences ➡️ Trackpad ➡️ Point & Click)
2. Enable Silent Clicking. Without this, clicking the trackpad is so loud. (System Preferences ➡️ Trackpad ➡️ Point & Click)

# Sound

1. Enable feedback when volume is changed. (System Preferences ➡️ Sound ➡️ Sound Effects)
2. Show volume in menu bar. (System Preferences ➡️ Sound ➡️ Sound Effects)

# Finder

1. Show Library folder. (Finder ➡️ Go to your home folder ➡️ Right click in the folder ➡️ Click Show View Options ➡️ Enable Show Library Folder)
2. Show Path Bar. (Finder ➡️ View menu ➡️ Show Path Bar)
3. Show Status Bar. (Finder ➡️ View menu ➡️ Show Status Bar)

# Safari

1. Show full URL. (Safari ➡️ Preferences ➡️ Advanced ➡️ Show full website address)
2. Show develop menu in menu bar. (Safari ➡️ Preferences ➡️ Advanced ➡️ Show Develop menu in menu bar)
3. Disable automatic opening downloaded file. (Safari ➡️ Preferences ➡️ General ➡️ Disable Open "safe" files after downloading)

# TextEdit

1. Use Plain text format for new document. (TextEdit ➡️ Preferences ➡️ New Document)
2. Disable Smart Quotes and Smart Dashes. (TextEdit ➡️ Preferences ➡️ New Document)

# Apps

1. [Go2Shell](https://zipzapmac.com/Go2Shell) to quickly open Terminal from Finder.
2. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com). I use it mostly for the Clipboard history.
3. DragonDrop. Unfortunately this app is [no longer available for download](https://twitter.com/DragonDropApp/status/618642103996821505?s=20). But I cannot live without it. It truly makes drag and drop better. So I copied it from my other Mac.
4. [FlatTerminal](https://github.com/ahmetsulek/flat-terminal) theme. It looks nice.
5. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) to watch stuff.
6. And any other useful apps.

What other configurations do you recommend? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/2co_p)!
