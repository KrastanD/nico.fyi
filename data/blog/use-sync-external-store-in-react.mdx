Recently, [someone asked on Twitter how to render the user's browser time in Next.js](https://twitter.com/chronark_/status/1762049915847376939), which uses React Server Components, without encountering hydration errors. While [Dan Abramov mentioned it's possible to suppress hydration mismatch errors](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov2/status/1762066351764406575) using the [`suppressHydrationWarning` prop](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#suppressing-unavoidable-hydration-mismatch-errors), displaying the browser's time without this workaround is indeed feasible.

[My initial approach](https://twitter.com/2co_p/status/1762063508697448919) was to check for the `window` object on the server:

```javascript
if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
  return null
}

return <>{new Date().toISOString()}</>
```

However, it was correctly noted that this still leads to hydration mismatches. This led me to utilize `useState` and `useEffect`:

```typescript
'use client';

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const TimeComponent = () => {
  const [date, setDate] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
      return;
    }
    setDate(new Date().toISOString());
  }, []);

  return <p>{date}</p>;
};

export default TimeComponent;
```

I was then reminded that achieving the same result with [useSyncExternalStore](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) is also possible. Although I seldom use this API, experimentation confirmed that it works:

```typescript
'use client';

import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

const TimeComponentWithExternalStore = () => {
  const date = useSyncExternalStore(
    () => () => {},
    () => new Date().toISOString(),
    () => ''
  );

  return <p>{date}</p>;
};

export default TimeComponentWithExternalStore;
```

We can go a step further by creating a component that renders only in the browser using `useSyncExternalStore`:

```typescript
'use client';
import { ReactNode, useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

const ClientOnly = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const isClient = useSyncExternalStore(
    () => () => {},
    () => true,
    () => false
  );

  if (isClient) {
    return <>{children}</>;
  }

  return null;
};

export default ClientOnly;
```

This component then can be used within a server component:

```typescript
// /app/something/page.tsx
import ClientOnly from './client-only';

const ExperimentPage = async () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
      <ClientOnly>
        <p>{new Date().toISOString()}</p>
      </ClientOnly>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExperimentPage;
```

Pretty neat, right? Have you incorporated `useSyncExternalStore` in your projects? I'd love to hear about it!
