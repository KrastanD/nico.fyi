Few years ago I made this little project to solve my own problem. I needed a solution to make a file publicly downloadable, but

|     |                                                          |

| ✅  | it should be FREE.                                       |
| ✅  | the files are password-protected.                        |
| ✅  | the files can be directly downloaded, no download page.  |
| ✅  | the files can be downloaded from script or command line. |

I couldn't find anything that meets those requirements. So I made this project that allows me to store the files in private GitHub repository and serving them through Vercel, both of which are FREE.

Today I updated it to Next.js 14.
