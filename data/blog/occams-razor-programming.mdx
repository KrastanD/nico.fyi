![Occam's Razor](/static/images/articles/ocamms-razor.png.webp)

Occam's Razor, a principle by William of Ockham, suggests that **the simplest solution is often correct**. This idea is relevant in today's tech landscape, especially in programming. But why?

## Simplicity is Key

At its core, Occam's Razor is about simplicity. In programming, this means choosing the simplest solution that gets the job done well. Simple code is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

## Readability Over Complexity

A golden rule in coding is to write readable code. Why? Because **code is read more often than it's written**. Occam's Razor pushes us to favor straightforward solutions. This means prioritizing clarity over cleverness. Use clear function declarations instead of convoluted expressions.

## Avoiding Over-Engineering

The razor also warns against over-engineering. It's tempting to create a complex system for a simple problem. Occam's Razor reminds us to stay grounded. We shouldn't get carried away with layers of abstraction or complex patterns when a few lines of simple code would work.

## Decision-Making in Libraries and Frameworks

When choosing libraries or frameworks, Occam's Razor can be a guide. It's easy to be impressed by a framework with many features. However, if your project only needs a few of these features, a lighter, more focused framework might be a better choice. This approach reduces dependencies and keeps the codebase lightweight.

## Refactoring with Occam's Razor

Refactoring is important in programming. Here, Occam's Razor can help. It encourages us to remove unnecessary complexity and simplify our code. This might involve replacing complex conditional chains with a simpler approach. Or using more descriptive type names in TypeScript for clarity.
