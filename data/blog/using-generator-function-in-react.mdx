Vercel recently announced the [new 3.0 version of their AI SDK](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-3-generative-ui) with support for Generative UI. What caught my eye was the new `render` method, where developers can map specific calls to React Server Components. Notably, it uses a [generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) to sequentially render different components, as shown below:

```typescript
import { render } from 'ai/rsc'
import OpenAI from 'openai'
import { z } from 'zod'

const openai = new OpenAI()

async function submitMessage(userInput) { // 'What is the weather in SF?'
  'use server'

  return render({
    provider: openai,
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },
      { role: 'user', content: userInput }
    ],
    text: ({ content }) => <p>{content}</p>,
    tools: {
      get_city_weather: {
        description: 'Get the current weather for a city',
        parameters: z.object({
          city: z.string().describe('the city')
        }).required(),
        render: async function* ({ city }) { // <--- THIS!
          yield <Spinner/>
          const weather = await getWeather(city)
          return <Weather info={weather} />
        }
      }
    }
  })
}
```

From what I have gathered, when the user requests the weather for a city, the SDK sends the prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI then "calls" `get_city_weather`, passing the requested city as the `city` parameter. Initially, the SDK "yields" or returns a `Spinner` component to the browser, then it retrieves the weather information from an external service, and finally returns a `Weather` component with the included weather data. Thus, instead of sending the weather data in, say, JSON format for React in the browser to render the `Weather` component, this SDK streams the rendered React components directly to the browser. Quite impressive.

What intrigued me, however, was the use of the generator function, prompting me to search the web to see if anyone has done something similar. I discovered that Tomasz Gil has written about using generator functions to implement dynamic breadcrumbs in the article [Using Generators in React Components](https://blog.tomaszgil.me/using-generators-in-react-components). He introduced a React hook named `useValueEffect`, which is used to calculate how many elements of the breadcrumbs can fit in the available space. Here is the code for `useValueEffect`:

```javascript
function useValueEffect(defaultValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(defaultValue)
  const effect = useRef(null)

  // Store the function in a ref so we can always access the current version
  // which has the proper `value` in scope.
  const nextRef = useRef(null)

  nextRef.current = () => {
    // Run the generator to the next yield.
    const newValue = effect.current.next()

    // If the generator is done, reset the effect.
    if (newValue.done) {
      effect.current = null

      return
    }

    // If the value is the same as the current value,
    // then continue to the next yield. Otherwise,
    // set the value in state and wait for the next layout effect.
    if (value === newValue.value) {
      nextRef.current()
    } else {
      setValue(newValue.value)
    }
  }

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // If there is an effect currently running, continue to the next yield.
    if (effect.current) {
      nextRef.current()
    }
  })

  const queue = useCallback(
    (fn) => {
      effect.current = fn()
      nextRef.current()
    },
    [effect, nextRef]
  )

  return [value, queue]
}
```

The idea of `useValueEffect` resembles [React's `useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), returning the value that changes over time along with the function to set the value. The difference is that `useValueEffect` returns a function into which one can pass a generator function that yields different values. Within the generator function, we can specify the conditions to set the new value over time.

In his case, he wanted to determine the number of items that could fit into the available width of his breadcrumb component. To achieve this, he first rendered all items, then calculated how many items could fit within the breadcrumb's width, and finally rendered only the visible items, as demonstrated below.

```javascript
export function Breadcrumbs({ children }) {
  const childrenCount = React.Children.count(children);
  const [visibleItemsCount, setVisibleItemsCount] = useValueEffect(
    childrenCount
  );

  const updateOverflow = useCallback(() => {
    function computeVisibleItems(currentVisibleItemsCount) {
      let newItemsCount = 0;
      // calculations...
      return newItemsCount;
    }

    setVisibleItemsCount(function* () {
      yield childrenCount;
      const newVisibleItems = computeVisibleItems(childrenCount);
      yield newVisibleItems;
    });
  }, [setVisibleItemsCount, childrenCount]);

  useLayoutEffect(updateOverflow, [children, updateOverflow]);

  ...
}
```

His example is very practical but a bit complicated. Therefore, I created a simpler example using a slightly modified version of his `useValueEffect`. Based on his code, I developed `useValueAsyncEffect` written in TypeScript. Unlike his code, this hook can handle [async generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator) and uses `useEffect` instead of `useLayoutEffect`, since I don't need the effect to [run before the browser repaints the screen](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect).

```typescript
type AsyncGeneratorYield<T> = AsyncGenerator<T, void, unknown>
type UseValueAsyncEffectReturnType<T> = [T, (fn: () => AsyncGeneratorYield<T>) => void]

export function useValueAsyncEffect<T>(defaultValue: T): UseValueAsyncEffectReturnType<T> {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<T>(defaultValue)
  const effect = useRef<AsyncGeneratorYield<T> | null>(null)

  const nextRef = useRef<() => Promise<void>>(async () => {})

  nextRef.current = async () => {
    if (!effect.current) return
    const newValue = await effect.current.next() // Await the next value from the async generator

    if (newValue.done) {
      effect.current = null
      return
    }

    if (value !== newValue.value) {
      setValue(newValue.value)
    } else {
      // Immediately try to get the next value if the current value hasn't changed
      await nextRef.current()
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // Execute the nextRef function if there is an effect to process
    if (effect.current) {
      nextRef.current()
    }
  })

  const queue = useCallback(
    (fn: () => AsyncGeneratorYield<T>) => {
      effect.current = fn()
      nextRef.current()
    },
    [effect, nextRef]
  )

  return [value, queue]
}
```

Using that hook, I created a simple simulation:

- The user clicks a button.
- The app displays a loading indicator and then fetches a movie from an external API or database.
- The app displays the movie information.
- The app shows another loading indicator and then fetches the cast of the movie from an external API or database.
- Finally, the app displays the cast information beneath the movie details.

You can see the [demo on this page](/experiments/use-value-effect) and the [code in the repository of this blog](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/app/experiments/use-value-effect/page.tsx). Note that the page doesn't actually make API calls; it simply simulates the pending state with `setTimeout`.

The code implementing the above use case with `useValueAsyncEffect` is provided below.

```typescript
export const MovieResult = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useValueAsyncEffect<ReactNode[]>([])

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        className="rounded-md bg-green-400 px-4 py-2 text-white"
        onClick={() => {
          setValue(async function* () {
            const loading = (
              <p key="1" className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                Faking fetching movies ...
              </p>
            )
            yield [loading]

            // Say we call an API to get a movie based on user's search term. The API returns a movie object that has the ID of the movie.
            await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
              setTimeout(() => resolve(), 3000)
            })

            const movie = <Movie />
            yield [movie]

            // next we call another API to get the casts based on the ID of the movie
            const loadingCasts = (
              <p key="1" className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                Faking fetching the movie casts ...
              </p>
            )

            yield [movie, loadingCasts]

            // fetch the movie casts
            await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
              setTimeout(() => resolve(), 3000)
            })

            const characters = <MovieCasts />
            yield [movie, characters]
          })
        }}
      >
        Get the movie
      </button>
      <div className="space-y-4 py-4">{value}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you can see, in the generator function, I yield different values over time, and that value, which is an array of React components, is rendered inside the `MovieResult` component.

We can take it further. What if we want to allow the user to cancel the operation? We can use the standard [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)! But we also need to define a UI state and the value from `useValueAsyncEffect` should also contain information of the status of the operation.

```typescript
export const MovieResult = () => {
  const cancel = useRef<AbortController | null>(null)
  const [state, setState] = useState<'idle' | 'loading' | 'cancelling'>('idle') // the state of the button. 'idle' is when the operation is not running anymore. 'loading' is when the operation is running. 'cancelling' is when the user just clicks the cancel button. The 'cancelling' statate is needed because the operation isn't immediately stopped when the user cancels it. Once the operation in generator function exits, the state should change to 'idle'.
  const [value, setValue] = useValueAsyncEffect<{
    components: ReactNode[] | null
    status: 'done' | 'cancelled' | 'pending' // status of the operation in the generator function. 'done' is when everything is completed. 'cencelled' when the generator function exits because of AbortController. 'pending' is when the generator function yield something but not the end of the operation
  } | null>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set state to 'idle' when the operation is cancelled or done so that the button's text goes back to Get the movie
    if (
      (cancel.current?.signal.aborted && value?.status === 'cancelled') ||
      value?.status === 'done'
    ) {
      setState('idle')
    }
  }, [value])

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (state === 'loading') {
      // cancel the operation when the operation is running
      cancel.current?.abort()
      setState('cancelling')
      return
    }
    setState('loading')
    cancel.current = new AbortController()
    setValue(async function* () {
      const loading = (
        <p key="1" className="text-sm text-gray-500">
          Faking fetching movies ...
        </p>
      )
      yield { components: [loading], status: 'pending' }

      await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(), 3000)
      })

      if (cancel.current?.signal.aborted) {
        yield { components: null, status: 'cancelled' }
        return
      }

      const movie = <Movie key="2" />
      yield { components: [movie], status: 'pending' }

      const loadingCasts = (
        <p key="3" className="text-sm text-gray-500">
          Faking fetching the movie casts ...
        </p>
      )

      yield { components: [movie, loadingCasts], status: 'pending' }

      await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(), 3000)
      })

      if (cancel.current?.signal.aborted) {
        yield { components: null, status: 'cancelled' }
        return
      }

      const characters = <MovieCasts key="4" />
      yield { components: [movie, characters], status: 'done' }
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button className="rounded-md bg-green-400 px-4 py-2 text-white" onClick={handleClick}>
        {state === 'loading' ? 'Cancel' : state === 'idle' ? 'Get the movie' : 'Cancelling...'}
      </button>
      {value?.components ? <div className="space-y-4 py-4">{value?.components}</div> : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is just a simple example to demonstrate the capabilities of `useValueAsyncEffect`. In production, it would be better to use [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) and [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to fetch the movie and cast data simultaneously and then render them. This hook is more useful if you need to perform several actions sequentially and update the UI simultaneously. For example, you might want to update 1000 rows in the database one or several rows at a time because you don't want to exhaust the available database connections. But as each row is processed, you want to show the status in the UI to the user.

I rarely use generator functions and found the term `yield` a bit confusing as a non-native speaker. But this stuff is fascinating! Have you tried using generator functions in your React projects? Let me know!
