There's a new CSS tool called [Open Props](https://open-props.style), an open-source collection of CSS variables. It's essentially a collection of [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) that can be utilized anywhere CSS is used.

Since these are merely CSS variables, we can integrate them with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). We don't even need to utilize everything Open Props offers. For instance, we can selectively use the Easing variables to enhance our CSS animations. As an example, I've added the `ease-elastic-in-out-5` animation to the blog post titles when hovered over on this website. Try hovering over the blog title above.

## How to use

First, let's install Open Props:

```shell
npm install open-props
```

Then, we'll update our CSS file. For this website, I updated the [tailwind.css file](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/css/tailwind.css):

```css
@import 'open-props/easings';
```

Next, we need to update the [tailwind.config.js file](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/tailwind.config.js):

```javascript
  theme: {
    extend: {
      transitionTimingFunction: {
        'spring-1': `var(--ease-spring-1)`,
        'spring-2': `var(--ease-spring-2)`,
        'spring-3': `var(--ease-spring-3)`,
        'spring-4': `var(--ease-spring-4)`,
        'spring-5': `var(--ease-spring-5)`,
        'elastic-in-out-1': `var(--ease-elastic-in-out-1)`,
        'elastic-in-out-2': `var(--ease-elastic-in-out-2)`,
        'elastic-in-out-3': `var(--ease-elastic-in-out-3)`,
        'elastic-in-out-4': `var(--ease-elastic-in-out-4)`,
        'elastic-in-out-5': `var(--ease-elastic-in-out-5)`,
      },
```

Finally, we can simply use the added class names in our components. For example, I updated the [blog title component](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/components/PageTitle.tsx) in the blog posts:

```typescript:components/PageTitle.tsx {3} showLineNumbers
export default function PageTitle({ children }: Props) {
  return (
    <h1 className="ease-elastic-in-out-5 ...other classes...">
      {children}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

That's it!
