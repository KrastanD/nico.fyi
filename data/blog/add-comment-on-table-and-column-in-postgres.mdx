I was just wondering if it's possible to add a comment on a table and column in Postgres. After a quick talk with AI, I found out that it's possible. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE "public"."table_name" IS 'This is a comment';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "public"."table_name"."column_name" IS 'This is a comment';
```

When you look at the table and column using a GUI client like TablePlus, you will see the comments:

I think it's a pretty useful feature to have since there are times when a developer uses a non-descriptive name for a table or column. I was kind of hoping that Prisma supports this, where comments in the schema file are automatically added to the migration files. The only workaround I can think of is to run Prisma's migration without executing it first and then add the comments manually.

For example, say you just created a schema file or you make some changes to the schema file. First, create a draft migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

Then add the comments manually:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE "public"."table_name" IS 'This is a comment';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "public"."table_name"."column_name" IS 'This is a comment';
```

Finally, apply the migration:

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Have you ever added a comment to a table or column in Postgres?
