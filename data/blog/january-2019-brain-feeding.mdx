The first out of (hopefully) 12 blog post series about what I read, listen to, watch, and play every month.

# Play

I'm into three games at this moment. On Nintendo Switch, I'm enjoying Valkyrie 4 Chronicles, an anime-style turn-based strategy game. What's not to like 😉 I have never played any Valkyrie games before but thankfully I don't need to to play this game.

On PS4, I'm playing Horizon Zero Dawn. The graphics of this game is amazing. The story is intriguing so far. The battle is a bit difficult for me but I'm getting used to it.

On mobile, I'm continuing to play Pokemon Go. The new player-vs-player battle is pretty fun especially since I'm in a weekly tournament against my college friends. I won the first week tournament but probably won't win the second week since seems like my friends learned some new tricks. 🤔

# Read

I saw this book when we were in Amsterdam and I remembered someone in Twitter recommended it. While it's hard to understand in some parts for me, it fed me with some interesting insights.

I listen to Japanese songs lately. New songs, like [Bump of Chicken's 話がしたいよ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6s8HF1WsJY) and [Radwimp's そっけない](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1vmfVpINbk), and old songs, like [平井堅's ノンフィクション](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC6IRyiaGGM) and [Mrs. Green Apple's 春秋](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1Ci-5lr-DA), are on repeat. As a matter of fact, I just stumbled upon 平井堅's ノンフィクション recently.

I'm also listening to Carlo Rovelli's The Order Of Time audiobook narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch when I have the time. Not only the book is interesting—time always intrigues me, but the voice of Cumberbatch is soothing. 😅

# Watch

I finally got the time to watch the [Advanced React tutorial videos by Wesbos](https://advancedreact.com). I skip some videos but I got to understand the complicated tools around [graphql](https://graphql.org), like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) and [Yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga). It also inspired me to start a new side-project related to graphql. Stay tuned 😉

On the entertainment side, we recently watched The Kominsky Method which is a terrific series. And only after finishing the season, we found out that it won [the Golden Globe 2019 best television series - musical or comedy award](https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/best-television-series-musical-or-comedy). Well deserved.
