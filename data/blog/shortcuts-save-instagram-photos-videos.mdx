I made this iOS Shortcuts to download public photos and videos from Instagram. Unfortunately, Instagram for iOS does not use iOS Sharing sheet so this Shortcut cannot be accessed quickly. But fortunately we can put Shortcut in Today's widget of iOS. Once it's shown in the widget, we just need to copy the instagram link, swipe down from the top left corner of the iPhone or iPad, then swipe right to reveal the widget, and tap the Shortcut.

Get the Shortcut [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6d09d61fd09942bea4400a66497caa8d). Check out the demo below (<a href="./instagram-shortcuts-demo.mp4">link to the video</a>).
