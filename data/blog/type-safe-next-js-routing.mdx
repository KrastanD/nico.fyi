I found a blog post that explains [how to make Next.js routing more type-safe](https://www.flightcontrol.dev/blog/fix-nextjs-routing-to-have-full-type-safety). It's an interesting concept, but when I tested the code, I encountered some issues. To address this, I created an npm package called [@nicnocquee/next-type-safe-routing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nicnocquee/next-type-safe-routing) and published it on npm.

The website also uses this library in certain areas, such as the [blog route](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/app/blog/routes.ts). You can find the code for this route on the GitHub repo of [nicnocquee/nico.fyi](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi).
