In one of the pull requests I reviewed, I noticed a pattern that I've seen in many pull requests. A React component had multiple UI states such as `loading`, `error`, and `success`. The author used multiple `useState` hooks to manage these states, which resulted in code that is hard to read and error-prone, for example:

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState(false)
  const [success, setSuccess] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && !error && !success && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && !loading && !success && <p>Error occurred</p>}
      {success && !loading && !error && <p>Operation completed successfully</p>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

These states are **distinct from each other**. When `loading` is true, the `error` and `success` states should be `false`. Using multiple `useState` hooks can cause unexpected behaviors, like accidentally setting two states to `true` simultaneously.

Instead, consider using the ["finite state machine" (FSM) pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). A FSM allows only a finite number of states. In the UI example above, a single `useState` can manage the current state more robustly and with less risk of error, as shown here:

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react'

type State = 'loading' | 'error' | 'success'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>('loading')

  const handleClick = () => {
    setState('loading')
    // Simulate an async operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      setState('success')
    }, 2000)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {state === 'loading' && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {state === 'error' && <p>Error occurred</p>}
      {state === 'success' && <p>Operation completed successfully</p>}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In some cases, such as when using [Tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) to fetch data, `useQuery` eliminates the need for separate `useState` hooks for `loading`, `error`, and `success` states:

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(...)

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error occurred</p>
  }

  return <p>Operation completed successfully {data}</p>
}
```

Let's consider another state called `locked`, indicating whether the user has unlocked the feature, based on a [403 status code](https://http.cat/status/403) from the server. Often developers might use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage this, which can add unnecessary complexity:

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [locked, setLocked] = useState(false)
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(...)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (error && error.status === 403) {
      setLocked(true)
    }
  }, [error])

  if (locked) {
    return <p>You are locked out</p>
  }
}
```

A better approach **derives** the `locked` state directly from the `error`:

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(...)

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  const locked = error?.status === 403

  if (locked) {
    return <p>You are locked out</p>
  }
}
```

This method avoids the need for additional state management with `useState` and `useEffect`.

When writing a React component, always consider whether `useState` and `useEffect` are necessary. Often, they are not.
