Recently, a splash was made in the tech community by the [unveiling of Devin](https://x.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000?s=20), a new AI software engineer created by Cognition Labs. Its creators claim that Devin not only aced practical engineering interviews at top AI firms but also completed actual projects on Upwork. This announcement has stirred a mixed bag of reactions within the developer community. While some critics highlighted bugs in Devin's demo or suggested the tasks were tailored to its training, others humorously wished future developers luck in maintaining Devin's code.

Yet, amidst the skepticism and jest, a significant conversation has emerged about the future of human creativity in the age of AI. A perspective, echoed by Indonesian developer [mgilangjanuar](https://twitter.com/mgilangjanuar), suggests that [while AI might replicate coding tasks, it cannot mimic the human capacity for generating ideas](https://x.com/mgilangjanuar/status/1767675844221444481?s=20). Initially, I found myself nodding in agreement, but a deeper reflection led me to challenge this assumption.

The notion that AI lacks the spark of creativity is quickly becoming outdated. Tools like ChatGPT have been instrumental in crafting travel plans, whipping up recipes, and brainstorming business ventures. But here's the catch: **AI's current idea generation requires a prompt, a nudge from humans to embark on a creative quest**.

This observation prompted me to ponder why humans generate ideas in the first place. The consensus among innovators is that most ideas spring from the desire to solve problems. Viewing through a problem-solving lens, we can see how even the most abstract inspirations serve as journeys toward resolution:

- **Creativity and Artistic Expression:** A way to navigate the challenge of self-expression or to provoke a response.
- **Personal Fulfillment:** Addressing the quest for achieving one's goals or finding happiness.
- **Philosophical Inquiry:** The pursuit of answers to life's big questions and ethical dilemmas.

Adopting this broad view of problem-solving, it's clear that AI can, in theory, be tasked with generating ideas aimed at bridging the gap between reality and aspiration. We can envision a not-so-distant future where we present AI, like [AutoGPT](https://docs.agpt.co) or other intelligent agents, with a business problemâ€”say, a low conversion rate on an app or website with a goal to reach a specific target percentage. From this problem statement, the AI could autonomously fetch data from analytics, generate a range of strategies, implement them, and evaluate whether the desired conversion rate has been achieved. Projects like AutoGPT exemplify this potential by enabling an AI to iteratively solve tasks with minimal human guidance, demonstrating a significant leap towards autonomous problem-solving capabilities in the digital realm.

However, there's a nuanced distinction to consider. AI, unlike humans, does not navigate the complexities of daily life. It is unaffected by personal hardships or societal issues, which are often catalysts for human creativity. **This limitation indicates that although AI can come up with ideas when prompted, it doesn't naturally have the spontaneous drive that fuels human creativity without any external prompts.**

As AI technology evolves, the distinction between human and machine capabilities blurs. Yet, the question remains: what roles will humans play in a future increasingly dominated by AI? This is not just a question for today but a profound inquiry for tomorrow's world, reminding us of the value and uniqueness of human creativity and experience.
