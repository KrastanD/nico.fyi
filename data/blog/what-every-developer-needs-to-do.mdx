One thing I wish I had done when I was younger is write more. Specifically, I regret not documenting the lessons I learned throughout my career. I should have written about the mistakes I made in software development and the solutions I found to overcome those challenges.

That's why my 2024 resolution was to write more. Initially, I planned to write five articles per week, but I have only managed to write two or three lately. Coming up with fresh ideas every week is challenging, but it seems to be paying off. The Google search performance of my blog has been steadily increasing.

This blog also achieved 1K Google Search Impact recently!

This may seem like a small achievement for some people, but we should celebrate small victories, right?

## The Importance of Writing

What I'm emphasizing in this post is that as a developer, especially when you're new to software development, it's crucial to write more.

**Writing down solutions helps you refer back to them later.** I often revisit this blog to find solutions I documented when facing the same problem again.

**Sharing your findings can also help others.** It creates a collaborative environment where we can learn from each other and improve our skills.

Writing online can also boost your career by increasing your visibility. However, gaining a large audience takes time. **SEO is a long-term game.** So start writing and keep at it—you'll eventually see results.

Writing is vital for developers because **a piece of code is read more often than it is written.** Being able to write readable and maintainable code is a valuable skill. You write not only code but also documentation. Therefore, regularly writing down your thoughts and learnings can improve your skills in both areas.

## Keep Writing

If you’re unsure of what to write about, **start with the problems you encounter in your work.** Each time you find a solution or create your own solution to a problem, document it.

You don’t need to worry about whether your topics will attract a large audience. Trying to go viral is a fool’s errand. Instead, concentrate on writing about the issues you encounter in your work and how you resolve them. Even if the solution seems so obvious that it doesn’t need documentation, it is still valuable to write it down because others will likely benefit from it as well.

Happy writing!
