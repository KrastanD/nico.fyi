summary: A tutorial on publishing private NPM packages to private GitHub repositories, reflecting on GitHub's unlimited private repos policy
---

Have you heard that [github is giving unlimited private repositories to all github users](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/)? Thanks, [Microsoft](https://github.blog/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/)! Unlimited private repositories is the only reason I put all my hobby projects in Gitlab. But now I can probably put some projects in Github as well.

Speaking of private thing, have you ever wanted to publish a private npm package for internal use? You can use [npm private registry for $7/month](https://www.npmjs.com/pricing). Or you can also use private git repository (in Github, Gitlab, own server, etc) for **free**.

The (probably) not-so-secret ingredient is [publish-to-git](https://github.com/Rush/publish-to-git).

# Installation

Install publish-to-git locally as dev dependency

```
npm i --save-dev publish-to-git
```

or globally

```
npm i -g publish-to-git
```

# Usage

Edit your package.json file in your project

```
"scripts": {
// ... other scripts
  "publish": "publish-to-git"
}
```

Now if you run `npm run publish`, it will run `npm pack`, then it will create a new tag based on your project's version and push the content to remote repository. For example, if your project's version as indicated in package.json file is "0.0.1", it will create a `v0.0.1` tag in the remote repository.

Once you publish the package, you can use it as dependency in another project by adding it in package.json file:

```
"dependencies": {
  "secret-package": "organization_or_user_name_in_github/secret-package#v0.0.1"
}
```

## Compilation

If you need to compile the project first using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), for example, you need to run the compilation before publishing it. For example, you can run babel to all js files in `src` directory and put the output in `dist` directory. We can tell publish-to-git that only `dist` directory that needs to be published and to be used by other projects, by specifying it in the "files" option in package.json

```
// package.json file
"private": true,
"main": "dist/index.js",
"version": "0.0.1",
"files": [
  "dist"
],
"scripts": {
  / ... other scripts
  "build": "babel src --out-dir dist,
  "publish": "npm run build && publish-to-git"
}
```

Now only your `dist` directory is published to `v0.0.1` tag in your private repository.
