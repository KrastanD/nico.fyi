One of the very common user interaction in a web application is calling an API end point where data mutation is performed when a button is clicked. Since it performs a mutation, **usually we don't want the user to be able to click the button again until the mutation is completed**. Otherwise there will be inconsistency in the user's data. For example, user needs to click a button to spend some points. But if the button is clicked again before the points are spent, the points will be deducted again.

The common way to solve this little problem in React is to use `useState` to store the loading state of the API call. Then we can use the `disabled` prop to disable the button until the loading state is `false`.

```typescript:do-something.tsx {3,6,10,13,22} showLineNumbers
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function DoSomething() {
  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        disabled={isPending}
        className="border rounded-md"
        onClick={async () => {
          setIsPending(true);
          await fetch("/about/api", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
              "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
          });

          console.log("Success");
          setIsPending(false);
        }}
      >
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

But there is another not-so-known way to do this using [useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) like this:

```typescript:do-something.tsx {3,6,10,13} showLineNumbers
"use client";

import { useTransition } from "react";

export default function DoSomething() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        disabled={isPending}
        className="border rounded-md"
        onClick={() => {
          startTransition(async () => {
            await fetch("/about/api", {
              method: "POST",
              headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
              },
            });

            console.log("Success");
          });
        }}
      >
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see, as long as the function passed to `startTransition` is running, the `isPending` value will stay `true`. And when the function is finished, the `isPending` value will be automatically set to `false`. Interestingly, this kind of usage is not documented in the [useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) page.

One more interesting thing to note when used in Next.js is that the **`startTransition` blocks navigation.** So if you click a `<Link>` component after clicking the button in the code above, the navigation will be blocked until the transition is finished. I think this is a convenient feature if you want to prevent the user from navigating away from the page while the transition, for example a data mutation, is running.
