I've just rolled out a minor update for my open source project, [Next Secure Download](https://github.com/nicnocquee/next-secure-download), now fully embracing the power of Next.js 14! Here’s what’s new:

1. **App Router Migration**: I've moved from the classic Pages router to the more dynamic [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), enhancing the project's flexibility and scalability.
2. **Brand New Icon**: Check out the sleek, new project icon! It's the fresh face of Next Secure Download.
3. **Dedicated Sample Page**: Experience the improvements first-hand on our sample page - now hosted on my personal domain: [https://nextsecure.nico.fyi](https://nextsecure.nico.fyi).
4. **Enhanced Security**: I've beefed up the security measures, especially when serving secret files. Peek at the [updated code](https://github.com/nicnocquee/next-secure-download/blob/ef74945afdc5a380e9f79bf61995aa9c0fd6d7ff/app/api/download/%5Bfile_name%5D/route.ts#L19) to see how it's safeguarding your file.
