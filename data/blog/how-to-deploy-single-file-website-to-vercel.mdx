Vercel is well known for deploying Next.js apps. But it is less known that it also supports [deploying projects from other frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks) like Angular, Solid, Svelte, and many more. Something even more obscure is that you can deploy a single file website to Vercel.

The secret is to use Vercel's Serverless functions. All you have to do is create a file in a directory called `api`, e.g., `api/hello.js`. In this file, you need to export a `GET` function that will be called by Vercel when the user visits the `/api/hello` endpoint.

```typescript:api/hello.js
export function GET(request) {
  return new Response(`Hello from ${process.env.VERCEL_REGION}`);
}
```

## Serving HTML

To show a website in this end point, we need to return a HTML response instead of text response as shown in the example above.

```typescript:api/hello.js
export async function GET() {
  const html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Vercel Region</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                display: flex;
                justify-content: center;
                align-items: center;
                min-height: 100vh;
                margin: 0;
                background-color: #f0f0f0;
            }
            .container {
                text-align: center;
                padding: 20px;
                background-color: white;
                border-radius: 8px;
                box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
                max-width: 800px;
                width: 100%;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Hello from ${process.env.VERCEL_REGION}</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
  `;

  return new Response(html, {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" },
  });
}
```

That's it! Now you just need to deploy the project to Vercel. You can initialize a Git repository and push the code to it then add a project in Vercel that points to the Git repository. Or you can use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) to deploy the project directly.

```shell
npx vercel
```

Once deployed, you can visit the website by visiting the URL of the project in Vercel. For example, if you deployed the project to `my-project.vercel.app`, you can visit `https://my-project.vercel.app/api/hello`. If you want to be able to access the website from the root URL, unfortunately we need to add another file called `vercel.json` to the project.

```json:vercel.json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/api/hello"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Data

Now let's try to serve a more than basic HTML page. Let's display a list of users which are stored in a database in [Turso](https://turso.tech). First, you need to create a database in Turso and get an auth token to access the database by following the [quick start guide](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/http/quickstart).

Then let's add a function to the `api/hello.js` file to fetch the users from the database.

```javascript:api/hello.js
function _getData() {
  const url = `${process.env.TORSO_DB_HTTP_URL}/v2/pipeline`;
  const authToken = process.env.TORSO_TOKEN;

  return fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      requests: [
        { type: "execute", stmt: { sql: "SELECT * FROM users" } },
        { type: "close" },
      ],
    }),
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => data.results[0].response.result.rows) // [[{"type":"integer","value":"1"},{"type":"text","value":"Nico"}],[{"type":"integer","value":"2"},{"type":"text","value":"Jobs"}]]
    .catch((err) => console.log(err));
}
```

Next we need to update the `GET` function in the `api/hello.js` file to fetch the data from the database before returning the HTML response.

```javascript:api/hello.js
export async function GET() {
  const data = await _getData();

  // Create a formatted table for users
  const userTable = `
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          ${data
            .map(
              (user) => `
            <tr>
              <td>${user[0].value}</td>
              <td>${user[1].value}</td>
            </tr>
          `
            )
            .join("")}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    `;

  const html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Vercel Region</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                display: flex;
                justify-content: center;
                align-items: center;
                min-height: 100vh;
                margin: 0;
                background-color: #f0f0f0;
            }
            .container {
                text-align: center;
                padding: 20px;
                background-color: white;
                border-radius: 8px;
                box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
                max-width: 800px;
                width: 100%;
            }
            table {
                width: 100%;
                border-collapse: collapse;
                margin-top: 10px;
            }
            th, td {
                padding: 10px;
                border: 1px solid #ddd;
            }
            th {
                background-color: #f2f2f2;
                font-weight: bold;
            }
            tr:nth-child(even) {
                background-color: #f9f9f9;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Users</h2>
            ${userTable}
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
  `;

  return new Response(html, {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" },
  });
}
```

We can even add a form to allow visitor to add new users to the database. The complete code is available [in my repo](https://github.com/nicnocquee/just-js).

## Conclusion

We often hear people complain that web development has become too complicated. They usually mention how they miss the simplicity of making websites without build steps, without CI/CD, and just uploading files to a server via SFTP. In this post, I want to show these people that it's _still_ possible to deploy a website by uploading it to Vercel directly using the Vercel CLI.

Moreover, if you hate having multiple files in your project and only want to have a single file like that _famous million-dollar PHP indie hacker guy (you know who)_, you can do it too! Well, two files, actually, sorry. But it's still possible.

Bonus:

- [Do you know you can even deploy a Python, Ruby, and Go function to Vercel?](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python)
