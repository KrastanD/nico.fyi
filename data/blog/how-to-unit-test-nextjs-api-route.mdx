[Zaher Ghaibeh](https://twitter.com/zaherg) asked me how to unit test a [Next.js API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers). But he ended up figuring it out for himself. And he's kind enough to share his solution with me in this [repository](https://github.com/zaherg/with-vitest).

His solution is to use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io). Vitest is a test runner for JavaScript and TypeScript that makes it easy to write and run tests against your code. MSW is a mocking library that allows you to mock HTTP requests and responses in your tests.

The idea is quite simple:

1. Create a dummy request based on the [NextRequest](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request).
2. Pass the mock request to the handler of the API route (GET, POST, etc).
3. Assert that the response is what you expect.
4. If necessary, intercept any requests made within the handler and mock them using MSW.

I then tried it out on this site. I added a test for the API route that stores the data in the Turso database for the [Should you use Vercel tool](/should-you-use-vercel) using the following steps:

1. Install vitest and msw.
2. Create a [setup file for vitest](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/__tests__/setup.ts). In this file I instantiate the MSW node server which will intercept all requests made within the API route handler.
3. Create a test for the API route in [the route.test.ts file](<https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/app/(other-pages)/should-you-use-vercel/api/route.test.ts>).

When the data is submitted, the request handler verifies that the [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) token is valid by sending a request to [Google's reCAPTCHA API](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify). If the token is valid, the request handler will then continue to store the data in the Turso database. So in this case, I need to intercept the request to Google's reCAPTCHA API and mock the response to return `success: true` or `success: false` based on the test case.

After that, I made sure that the Turso client instance connects to the [in-memory database](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/reference#in-memory-databases) instead of the real database by setting the `:memory:` value for the `TURSO_DB_URL` environment variable.

A few things to note based on my initial experience with Vitest and MSW:

1. Don't use `bun run test` to run the tests. As of this writing, MSW doesn't seem to be able to intercept the requests when running the tests with bun. Use `npm run test` instead.
2. You must explicitly tell Vitest where to find the environment file.

```typescript
    env: loadEnv('test', process.cwd(), ''),
```

3. If the function to be tested is async, you must use `await` when calling the `expect` function:

```typescript
await expect(() => POST(req)).rejects.toThrow()
```

4. If you use the [module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases) in your test file, as I did [here](<https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/app/(other-pages)/should-you-use-vercel/api/route.test.ts>), you need to add them to the [vitest config file](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nico.fyi/blob/main/vitest.config.ts):

```typescript
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@/__tests__': fileURLToPath(new URL('./__tests__', import.meta.url)),
  },
},
```
