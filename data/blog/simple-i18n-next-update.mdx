On the weekend, I added two new features to the [simple-i18n-next](https://github.com/nicnocquee/simple-i18n-next) CLI tool. The first one is to support nested keys. The second one is to support multiple JSON files in each language directory.

## Nested keys

Now you can use nested keys in your translation files. For example, if you have a translation file like this:

```json:locales/en/messages.json
{
  "landing": {
    "title": "Welcome to my website!",
    "subtitle": "This is a subtitle"
  }
}
```

The CLI will generate two constants you can use in your code: `landingTitle` and `landingSubtitle`. You can use them like this:

```tsx:page.tsx
import { landingTitle, landingSubtitle } from '@/locales/.generated/server'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{landingTitle}</h1>
      <p>{landingSubtitle}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Multiple JSON files

[Originally](/blog/internationalization-for-next-js), the CLI read only the `messages.json` files in each of the language directories. **Now, the CLI will read all JSON files in the language directories**. The default file is still `messages.json`. So, if you have `locales/en/messages.json` and `locales/en/landing-page.json` like this:

```json:locales/en/messages.json
{
    "name": "My awesome website",
    "greeting": "Hello, {{name}}"
}
```

```json:locales/en/landing-page.json
{
  "title": "Welcome to my website!",
  "subtitle": "This is a subtitle"
}
```

The CLI will generate 4 constants you can use in your code: `name`, `greeting`, `landingPageTitle`, and `landingPageSubtitle`. As you can see, the CLI will prefix the constants with a camel-cased version of the file name. So `landing-page.json` becomes `landingPage` prefix. However, the keys in the default file (`messages.json`) are not prefixed.

So that's it! Please give it a try and let me know if you have any issues. And if you have any suggestions, please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/2co_p)!
