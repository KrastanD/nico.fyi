## The Challenge

Switzerland has four national languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. The first three languages are the languages which are used by the majority of the people. For that reason most web apps I made here need to support at least those three and English in some.

When developing our first web app, I explored the popular React library for internationalization, [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl). But I decided not to use it since it's overkill for our simple requirement: we just need to display different strings based on the selected language.

## Keep it simple!

Our solution was just to use a simple Javascript object which contains the strings for each of the languages.

```javascript
// @flow
// locales.js file
// you can separate the translations object into different files if you want

export const de = {
  title: 'iTheorie Online-Lernen',
  welcomeTo: 'Willkommen bei $title',
  // and so on ...
}
export type StringsType = typeof de

export const fr: StringsType = {
  title: 'Apprentissage en ligne iTheorie',
  welcomeTo: 'Bienvenue chez $title',
}
```

To use the translation, we just need to pass the object to the components that need them.

```javascript
export const TitleComponent = ({
  strings = require('./locales').default,
}: {
  strings: StringsType,
}) => <p>{strings.siteTitle}</p>
```

We use [Flow](https://flow.org/) to add type annotation for our translation object. By using it, not only we can prevent missing translation strings, we can also get autocompletion in editor, like [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), when using it in our React components.

To handle language switching, we can use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [React's built-in Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). When using Redux, we can create a reducer that will return the translations object based on the selection language.

```javascript
export const defaultState = {
  selected: 'de',
  messages: require('./locales').de,
}

export default (
  state: StringsType = defaultState,
  action: {
    type: 'SET_LANGUAGE_ACTION',
    payload: {
      selected: string,
      messages: StringsType,
    },
  }
): LanguageState => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_LANGUAGE_ACTION': {
      return {
        ...state,
        ...action.payload,
      }
    }
    default:
  }
  return state
}
```

To support formatted message, we created a small function to replace certain placeholder strings with the actual string.

```javascript
const escapeRegex = (value: string) =>
  value.replace(/[\-\[\]{}()*+?.,\\\^$|#\s]/g, '\\$&')

export const formatted = (text: string, replacement: Object): string => {
  var newText = text
  Object.keys(replacement).forEach(key => {
    let regex = new RegExp(escapeRegex(key), 'g')

    newText = newText.replace(regex, replacement[key])
  })
  return newText
}
```

For example, we have a translation string with key `welcomeTo` and value `Willkommen bei $title` in the translation object for German. We use the `formatted` function to replace `$title` with `iTheorie Online-Lernen`

```javascript
export const Greeting = ({ strings }: { strings: StringsType }) => {
  const stringToUse = formatted(strings.welcomeTo, {
    $title: 'iTheorie Online-Lernen',
  })
  return <p>{stringToUse}</p>
}
```

## Conclusion

This solution is satisfying for several reasons:

- No need for 3rd party dependency
- Prevent missing translation
- Auto completion in code editor.
