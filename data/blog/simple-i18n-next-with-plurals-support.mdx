After releasing my [simple-i18n-next](https://github.com/nicnocquee/simple-i18n-next) tool [last week](/blog/internationalization-for-next-js), [Václav Hodek](https://x.com/vaclavhodek) from [Localazy](https://localazy.com) asked if it supported pluralization. I hadn't thought about it before, but I thought it would be a good idea to add it.

So I started by first researching how other tools support pluralization. It turned out that it's not as simple as handling "an apple" and "two apples." _It's more complicated than that_. For example, in German, you can have "ein Apfel" or "zwei Äpfel," just like in English. Meanwhile, in Japanese, there are no different forms for "one apple" and "two apples," so you have to use the same form for both: リンゴ1個 and リンゴ2個. Other languages like Arabic even have 6 different plural forms!

The complexity doesn't stop there. **There are also different plural forms for the ordinal numbers**! For example, in English, you can have "1st apple," "2nd apple," "3rd apple," and "4th apple," which indicates that there are four plural forms. But in German, you just need to use the same form for the ordinal numbers: 1. Apfel, 2. Apfel, 3. Apfel, 4. Apfel.

To solve this, I decided to follow the agreed convention as documented in the [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules), which defines 6 categories of the plural forms: `zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, and `other`.

**These categories are merely mnemonics**—their names don't strictly indicate the category's exact contents. For instance, in both English and French, the number 1 falls under the category `one` (singular). In English, all other numbers are classified as plural and given the category `other`. In French, however, the number 0 is also categorized as `one`, not `other` or `zero`, because units qualified by 0 are treated as singular.

According to the document, **a common misconception is that `one` applies only to the number 1**. In reality, `one` is a category for any number that behaves like 1. In some languages, for example, `one` includes numbers ending in "1" (such as 1, 21, 151) but excludes numbers ending in 11 (like 11, 111, 10311).

Thankfully, I don't need to write the code to determine the rules of which numbers go into which categories by myself. JavaScript has already a built-in API to do that: [Intl.PluralRules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules). I just need to pass the language code to it, and it will return the rules for that language.

```typescript
const pr = new Intl.PluralRules()
pr.select(0) // 'other' if in US English locale
pr.select(1) // 'one' if in US English locale
pr.select(2) // 'other' if in US English locale
```

There is also an API to get the plural categories for a given language:

```typescript
let categories = new Intl.PluralRules('en').resolvedOptions().pluralCategories
console.log(categories) // ['one', 'other']
categories = new Intl.PluralRules('en', { type: 'ordinal' }).resolvedOptions().pluralCategories
console.log(categories) // [ 'few', 'one', 'two', 'other' ]
```

Using these APIs, I added the pluralization support to simple-i18n-next. You just need to add one of the following suffixes to let the script know that you want to use plurals: `_one`, `_two`, `_few`, `_many`, `_other`, or `_zero` for cardinal numbers, and `_ordinal_one`, `_ordinal_two`, `_ordinal_few`, `_ordinal_many`, `_ordinal_other`, or `_ordinal_zero` for ordinal numbers.

For example, you can create a `locales/en/messages.json` file that contains the following content:

```json:locales/en/messages.json
{
  "book_one": "One book",
  "book_other": "{{count}} books",
  "movie_ordinal_one": "1st movie",
  "movie_ordinal_two": "2nd movie",
  "movie_ordinal_few": "3rd movie",
  "movie_ordinal_other": "{{count}}th movie"
}
```

and a `locales/de/messages.json` file that contains the following content:

```json:locales/de/messages.json
{
  "book_one": "Ein Buch",
  "book_other": "{{count}} Bücher",
  "movie_ordinal_other": "{{count}}. Film"
}
```

Then in the RSC component like `page.tsx`, you can use the generated function like this:

```tsx:page.tsx
import {
  SupportedLanguage,
  bookWithCount,
  movieWithOrdinalCount,
} from "@/locales/.generated/server";
export default function Home({
  params: { lang },
}: Readonly<{ params: { lang: SupportedLanguage } }>) {
  return (
    <main>
      <div>
        <p>{movieWithOrdinalCount(lang, 1)}</p>
        <p>{movieWithOrdinalCount(lang, 2)}</p>
        <p>{movieWithOrdinalCount(lang, 3)}</p>
        <p>{movieWithOrdinalCount(lang, 4)}</p>
        <p>{movieWithOrdinalCount(lang, 5)}</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>{bookWithCount(lang, 1)}</p>
        <p>{bookWithCount(lang, 2)}</p>
        <p>{bookWithCount(lang, 3)}</p>
        <p>{bookWithCount(lang, 4)}</p>
        <p>{bookWithCount(lang, 5)}</p>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

which will render the following HTML when the language is German (`de`):

```html
<main>
  <div>
    <p>1. Film</p>
    <p>2. Film</p>
    <p>3. Film</p>
    <p>4. Film</p>
    <p>5. Film</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>1 Buch</p>
    <p>2 Bücher</p>
    <p>3 Bücher</p>
    <p>4 Bücher</p>
    <p>5 Bücher</p>
  </div>
</main>
```

and when the language is English (`en`):

```html
<main>
  <div>
    <p>1st movie</p>
    <p>2nd movie</p>
    <p>3rd movie</p>
    <p>4th movie</p>
    <p>5th movie</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>One book</p>
    <p>2 books</p>
    <p>3 books</p>
    <p>4 books</p>
    <p>5 books</p>
  </div>
</main>
```

In a client component, you can use the generated function like this:

```tsx:client/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useStrings } from "@/locales/.generated/client/hooks";

export default function ClientComponent() {
  const lang = useSelectedLanguageFromPathname();
  const [, plurals] = useStrings(
    [
      "bookWithCount",
      "movieWithOrdinalCount",
    ],
    lang
  );
  if (!plurals) return null;
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>{plurals.bookWithCount(1)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.bookWithCount(2)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.bookWithCount(3)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.bookWithCount(4)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.bookWithCount(5)}</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>{plurals.movieWithOrdinalCount(1)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.movieWithOrdinalCount(2)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.movieWithOrdinalCount(3)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.movieWithOrdinalCount(4)}</p>
        <p>{plurals.movieWithOrdinalCount(5)}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

One thing to note is that even with the pluralization support, the strings being sent to the client are still **only** the required strings. For example, the `movieWithOrdinalCount` function above only contains the strings for the selected language. If the selected language is English, it will only send down the English strings defined in `movie_ordinal_one`, `movie_ordinal_two`, `movie_ordinal_few`, and `movie_ordinal_other` in `locales/en/messages.json`. If the selected language is German, it will only send down the German strings defined in `movie_ordinal_other` in `locales/de/messages.json`. Nothing more!

It has been a fascinating learning experience to add pluralization support to simple-i18n-next. I hope you find it useful and that it helps you in your projects.

Give it a try and let me know if you have any issues! You can also check an example of a Next.js project that uses the generated code [here](https://github.com/nicnocquee/simple-i18n-next-example).
