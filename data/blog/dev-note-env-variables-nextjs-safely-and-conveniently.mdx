**UPDATE May 11, 2020**

As of version 9.4, [NextJS finally has proper environment variables support](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#new-environment-variables-support). Simply put the variables in `.env` file:

- Environment variables are only available in the Node.js environment by default.
- Environment variables prefixed with NEXT*PUBLIC* are exposed to the browser.

# Problem

I really like [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/). But their recommendation to [add environment variable to the Javascript bundle](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/environment-variables) is not appropriate in my opinion. According to the documentation, you need to add the environment variables in the `next.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    customKey: 'my-value',
  },
}
```

However, this next.config.js file is usually commited to the project's repository. So if some of the environment variables are sensitive information (e.g., API keys), that information could leak to public.

# Solution #1

If you use Vercel to host your app, you can [add environment variables from the Project Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables) in vercel dashboard. Environment Variables are accessible during both Build Step and Runtime, and can be configured for Production, Preview, and Development Environments individually.

Once you add your environment variables to Vercel, you need to add the name of the environment variables to next.config.js file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    SECRET_SOMETHING: process.env.SECRET_SOMETHING,
  },
}
```

# Solution #2

The most popular way to use environment variables is using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv). To use dotenv in nextjs app, first install it

```
# with npm
npm install dotenv

# or with Yarn
yarn add dotenv
```

Then define the environment variables in `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Usually, you can ignore this file in your repository.

```
SECRET_SOMETHING=XXXXXX
```

Then expose it to your nextjs app in next.config.js file,

```javascript
require('dotenv').config()

module.exports = {
  env: {
    SECRET_SOMETHING: process.env.SECRET_SOMETHING,
  },
}
```

But adding the variables one by one is such a chore. So I wrote this small function to filter environment variables with certain prefixes.

```javascript
// next.config.js file
require('dotenv').config()

const getEnvWithPrefixes = (prefixes = ['REACT_APP_', 'FIREBASE_']) => {
  return Object.keys(process.env).reduce((prev, curr) => {
    if (prefixes.some((p) => curr.startsWith(p))) {
      return {
        ...prev,
        [curr]: process.env[curr],
      }
    }

    return prev
  }, {})
}

module.exports = {
  env: getEnvWithPrefixes(),
}
```

Using this `getEnvWithPrefixes` function, you need to define your environment variables' names with certain prefixes. In the above example, the names can be prefixed with either `REACT_APP_` or `FIREBASE_` like the following:

```
REACT_APP_SECRET=XXXXXX
FIREBASE_KEYS=XXXXXX
```

We use prefixes to prevent unrelated environment variables from leaking to your project. This way, we don't need to update next.config.js whenever we add a new environment variable to `.env` file.
