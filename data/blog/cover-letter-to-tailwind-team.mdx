I am writing to express my keen interest in joining your team. I love Tailwind CSS; it has transformed how I approach CSS, making it genuinely fun for the first time. I am very excited about the chance to help make Tailwind easier to use for developers worldwide.

## My Interesting Projects

Among my open-source initiatives, [Appolo](https://github.com/nicnocquee/appolo) holds a special place. Although not directly aligned with Tailwind CSS's core domain, it represents a significant milestone for me. App developers have shown a lot of interest and support for this Jekyll theme in the open-source community, making it my most starred repository on GitHub. The success of Appolo demonstrates my ability to create solutions that resonate with developers and contribute to the broader software ecosystem.

In addition to Appolo, I led the development of [Monika](https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika), an open-source monitoring tool. While not focused on CSS or frontend design, this project honed my leadership skills and deepened my understanding of managing diverse, remote teams working on multiple projects. It showcases my ability to navigate complex team environments effectively.

## Open-source Contributions

One of my proudest moments in open-source was with my project, [Delightful iPhone app](https://github.com/delightfulapp/delightful), which marked my first time making money from open-source. Additionally, my contributions to and involvement in Monika, especially this [pull request on Monika](https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/pull/1165), showcase my approach to problem-solving and knowledge sharing. This reflects my keen interest in peer learning and code review as tools for team growth.

## Leadership Experience

I have led a team of ten remote developers in Indonesia from my location in Switzerland. This role presented unique challenges, including navigating a significant time zone difference, bridging skill gaps, and managing the complexity of having every team member work on several projects simultaneously. To address these challenges, I established detailed guidelines and implemented a lot of automation, ensuring our projects ran smoothly and efficiently without sacrificing quality or speed.

## Technical Writing

I also have experience in technical writing, having recently published ["Pull Request Best Practices"](https://pr.nico.fyi) and maintained an active [blog](https://nico.fyi), where I share insights from my experiences and explore new ideas in software development.

## In Conclusion

While I recognize that there may be gaps in my experience relative to some of Tailwind CSS's specific needs, I am eager to learn and adapt quickly. I believe my passion for debugging and improving code, coupled with my solid skills in web and iOS development, makes me a valuable addition to your team.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the continued success and innovation of Tailwind CSS. Thank you for considering my application. I hope to hear from you soon to discuss the potential for collaboration further.

Warm regards,

Nico
